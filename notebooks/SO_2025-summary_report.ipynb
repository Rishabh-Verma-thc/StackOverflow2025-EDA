    "## 📌 3. Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the major insights, each paired with one selected plot representing that area of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.1 What are the most used Communication platforms used by Developers in 2025?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Percentage Distribution of Communication Platforms Used](../visualization/commPlatform_usage%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The platform distribution shows **Stack Overflow** as the most frequently used platform. This is expected and may be somewhat biased, given that the dataset originates from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.\n",
    "- Excluding Stack Overflow, the next most used platforms are:\n",
    "  - **GitHub – 12.9%**\n",
    "  - **YouTube – 11.7%**\n",
    "  - **Reddit – 10.3%**\n",
    "- Combined, these three platforms account for **approximately 35%** of all platform mentions, indicating that developers rely heavily on a mix of code hosting, video learning, and community-driven discussion platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.2 Most common Programming Languages used by Devs in 2025?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top 10 most used Programming Languages](../visualization/progLang_usage%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;The distribution shows that `web technologies` (`JavaScript`, `HTML/CSS`, `TypeScript` with a total of `28%`) and  \n",
    "&emsp;`data/automation technologies` (`Python`, `SQL`, `Bash` with a toal of `27.1%`) dominate the landscape, reflecting modern developer workflows.  \n",
    "&emsp;Compiled, strongly typed languages(`Java`, `C#`, `C++`) remain important but are now secondary in overall usage volume within this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.3 Are certain Industries more dominated by more experienced workers?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution of Industry with Average Work Experience](../visualization/Industry_avgWorkExp%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;The average work exp has an even distribution across different industries showcasing no single industry is dominated by devs with  \n",
    "&emsp;more or less work experience respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.4 Are younger developers entering the fields rely heavily on some few learning methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Learning Methods Distribution for 18-24 years Age group](../visualization/young_learnMtd%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning methods are fairly `evenly distributed`, with no single method dominating the preferences of young developers.\n",
    "- `Coding bootcamps` stand out as an outlier, used by only `1.6%` of young developers — noticeably lower compared to all other learning options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.5 How coding experience correlates to salary?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Salary by Years Coded](../visualization/AvgSalary_yrsCoded%28line%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;The average salary stays consistently below the survey-wide mean annual salary ($115,665.58)   \n",
    "&emsp;for respondents with less than 20 years of experience.  \n",
    "&emsp;Beyond the 20-year mark, the average salary remains consistently above the mean, and the gap increases noticeably as experience grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.6 Does education level still correlate with salary in 2025—or is experience more important?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Salary by Work Exp](../visualization/AvgSalary_workExp%28line%29.png) ![Average Salary for different Education Level](../visualization/avgSalary_edLevel%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Work Experience and Salary\n",
    "The analysis shows a strong positive correlation between work experience and average annual salary.  \n",
    "In the early-career range, the salary curve rises sharply, indicating that the initial years of experience contribute the most rapid salary growth.  \n",
    "Beyond approximately **9 years of experience**, the average salary remains consistently above the overall field average.  \n",
    "This highlights the importance of accumulating experience, especially during the early stages of one’s career.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Education Level and Salary\n",
    "Education level also shows a generally positive relationship with salary, but the differences between degree levels are relatively small in this survey sample.  \n",
    "Notably, individuals with **Associate degrees** appear to have the highest average salary in the dataset.  \n",
    "However, this is best explained by **selection bias**: Associate degree holders in this survey tend to work in highly specialized, high-paying technical roles, whereas Bachelor’s and Master’s degree holders are a much larger and more diverse group—including many juniors and respondents from lower-income regions—which lowers their overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, **work experience** is the strongest determinant of salary growth, particularly during the first decade of one’s career.  \n",
    "Additionally, entering a **specialized, high-demand field** early on can lead to higher earnings regardless of the degree level.  \n",
    "This suggests that both **accumulated experience** and the **choice of field** play crucial roles in achieving higher-paying job outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.7 Which Dev Role show the highest likelihood of accepting newer devs?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution of Dev Roles for Devs in 18-24yrs Age group](../visualization/young_devrole%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;A significant share of young developers work in full-stack, front-end, or back-end roles,  \n",
    "&emsp;which together account for 61.4% of the group.  \n",
    "&emsp;This indicates that these domains remain the most common entry-level pathways for early-career developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.8 Does Age correlate to job satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Job Satisfaction by Age Group](../visualization/JobSat_age%28line%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;Job satisfaction remains remarkably consistent across all age groups.  \n",
    "&emsp;Even though there are minor fluctuations (e.g., slightly higher satisfaction in older groups), these differences are small   \n",
    "&emsp;and practically insignificant. The line plot confirms that age does not meaningfully influence job satisfaction in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.9 What tasks do developers use AI for?\n",
    "\n",
    "![AI tools usecase distribution](../visualization/AItools_usecase%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI is primarily used for core coding tasks `Writing code – 14.04%`, `Searching for answers – 13.27%` &   \n",
    "`Learning new concepts/technologies – 11.28%` for combined ***38.59%***  \n",
    "which shows that AI serves as a real-time coding assistant, helping developers write and understand code faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging is a major use case which includes: `Debugging/fixing code – 11.21%` & `Testing code – 6.55%`  \n",
    "for combined ***17.76%*** reflects high trust in AI for troubleshooting and error resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation tasks: `Documenting code – 7.20%`, `Creating/maintaining documentation – 6.50%` &  \n",
    "`Generating content/synthetic data – 6.82%` for combined ***14.02%*** highlights AI usage in repetitive, low-engagement tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low adoption in production, analytics, and planning includes: `Project planning – 4.07%`,      \n",
    "`Predictive analytics – 3.03%`  & `Deployment & monitoring – 2.49%` for combined ***9.59%***  \n",
    "indicates devs still rely on established tools and human oversight for mission-critical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.10 How do developers feel about AI in their work life?\n",
    "\n",
    "![AI Usage Sentiment Distribution](../visualization/AIUsage_sentiment%28hbar%29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;Most respondents hold a positive attitude toward AI in the workplace, with `(61.11%)` `positive sentiments` reponses.  \n",
    "&emsp;`(17.98%)` account for `neutral` perspectives, while `(20.92%)` shows `negative` sentiment towards AI usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;This suggests a strong overall acceptance of AI within professional environments, with positivity outweighing negativity by a significant margin.\n",
